# Refactoring Utilities

Welcome to the mystical realm of code transformation within CODEMAGE.jl. In this section, we delve into the arcane arts of refactoring, a crucial spell in any code mage's grimoire. Refactoring your Julia code with CODEMAGE.jl is not just about changing names or structures; it's about enhancing clarity, maintainability, and the overall magic of your code.

## `refactor_function!`

The `refactor_function!` spell allows you to rename functions or change parameters in your Julia codebase. This powerful incantation ensures that your functions are always aptly named, reflecting their true purpose and power.

### Usage

To use `refactor_function!`, you need to specify the function and the changes you wish to apply. Here is how you can invoke this spell:

```julia
using CODEMAGE

# Example: Renaming a function
refactor_function!(old_function_name, :old_function_name => :new_function_name)
```

### Parameters

- `func`: The function you wish to refactor.
- `changes::Pair`: A pair indicating the old name (key) and the new name (value) of the function.

### Example

Let's say you have a function named `calculate_magic` that you want to rename to `summon_elements`. Here's how you would cast this spell:

```julia
refactor_function!(calculate_magic, :calculate_magic => :summon_elements)
```

Upon successful execution, you will see:

```
Function calculate_magic has been successfully renamed to summon_elements.
```

### Error Handling

If you attempt to refactor a function that does not exist or cannot be refactored, CODEMAGE.jl will alert you with an error:

```
Function old_function_name does not exist or cannot be refactored.
```

This ensures that your refactoring spells do not misfire, maintaining the integrity and stability of your magical codebase.

## Conclusion

Refactoring is an essential skill for any adept code mage. With `refactor_function!` provided by CODEMAGE.jl, you can ensure that your code remains clean, efficient, and truly enchanting. Embrace the power of refactoring and watch as your code transforms before your very eyes, becoming a more potent and streamlined conduit of your programming intent.
