# Debugging with CODEMAGE.jl

Welcome to the mystical realm of debugging in Julia using CODEMAGE.jl. In this chapter, we delve into the arcane arts of `Debugmancy`, where you will learn to wield powerful charms to track down and understand the elusive bugs that haunt your code.

## The `debug_inspect` Charm

The `debug_inspect` function is a fundamental spell in any code mage's arsenal. It allows you to peer deeply into the essence of your variables, revealing their secrets and aiding in the swift resolution of bugs.

### Usage

To use `debug_inspect`, simply pass the variable you wish to investigate as an argument. Here's how you can invoke this spell:

```julia
using CODEMAGE

# Assume `mysterious_variable` is defined in your magical script
mysterious_variable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Cast the debug_inspect spell to reveal its properties
debug_inspect(mysterious_variable)
```

### Output

When you cast `debug_inspect`, it outputs the following information about the variable:

- **Type:** Displays the data type of the variable.
- **Value:** Shows the current value held by the variable.
- Additional properties based on the type:
  - For numbers: Numeric properties such as whether it is an integer and if it is finite.
  - For arrays: Details like dimensions and element type.

Here is an example output for an array:

```
Inspecting variable...
Type: Array{Int64,1}
Value: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Array properties:
  - Dimensions: (5,)
  - Element type: Int64
Detailed inspection completed.
```

## Best Practices

While `debug_inspect` is powerful, use it wisely to avoid cluttering your console with too much information. It is best used when you have narrowed down potential sources of bugs and need a detailed look at specific variables.

## Conclusion

With `debug_inspect` and the other tools provided by CODEMAGE.jl, you are well-equipped to tackle any bugs that dare to disturb your code's tranquility. Remember, the path to mastering debugging is continuous learning and practice. May your bugs be few and your code run smoothly!
