# Performance Elixirs

Welcome to the mystical realm of performance optimization within CODEMAGE.jl. Here, we provide you with powerful elixirs to enhance the speed and efficiency of your Julia incantations. Dive into the arcane arts of profiling and benchmarking to ensure your code runs not only correctly but swiftly, like a shadow in the night.

## Features

**Performance Elixirs** in CODEMAGE.jl are designed to give you a deeper understanding and control over the computational performance of your spells (code). Here's what you can conjure with our tools:

### Profiling

Discover which parts of your code are consuming the most time and resources. Use this knowledge to focus your optimization efforts where they are most needed.

### Benchmarking

Measure the speed of your code under different conditions to ensure your optimizations are effective across a variety of environments and inputs.

## Using Performance Elixirs

To harness the power of performance optimization, you need to invoke the `optimize_performance` function. This function takes a block of your code and performs both profiling and benchmarking, returning insightful metrics.

### Example Usage

Here's how to use the `optimize_performance` function to optimize a magical function:

```julia
using CODEMAGE.performance

# Define a block of code
code_block = () -> begin
    # Your complex code logic here
    sum([i^2 for i in 1:10000])
end

# Optimize performance
optimize_performance(code_block)
```

When you run this, you will see output like:

```
ðŸ”® Optimizing performance... Please wait.
âœ¨ Profiling complete. Analyzing results...
ðŸŒŸ Benchmarking...
```

Followed by detailed profiling and benchmarking results that will help you understand how your code performs and where it can be improved.
